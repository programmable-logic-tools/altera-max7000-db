# POF file format specification

This is a third-party specification for Altera's POF file format,
reverse-engineered from outputs generated by Quartus 13 for MAX7000 family CPLDs.

POF is a container format for blocks of data.
All numbers are in little-endian representation.

| Size | Type | Purpose | Content |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 4 bytes | string | Magic signature | "POF" |
| 4 bytes | ? | Format version? | 0x00 00 01 00 |
| 4 bytes | uint32_t | Block count | e.g. 6 |
| remaining file| pof_block_t[] | Blocks | Concatenation of the specified number of blocks |
