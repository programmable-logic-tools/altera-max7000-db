<h1>The Altera {:s} CPLD bitstream format</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

This page is an inofficial documentation for Altera's {:s} CPLD bitstream format.
It is presented here in the hope that at some point
the information here may be sufficient to allow implementation of third-party software
to support this programmable logic device,
namely in the context of <a href="https://symbiflow.github.io/">SymbiFlow</a>.
<br/><br/>
This is an automatically generated page.
The corresponding generator can be found <a href="https://github.com/programmable-logic-tools/altera-max7000-db">here</a>.
<br/><br/>
The official way to generate bitstreams for this device is to use Altera Quartus-II.
Quartus-II produces POF files as output, which contain the raw bitstream alongside some metadata,
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Vector_Format">SVF</a> files for JTAG programming.
For software tools handling POF files, see <a href="https://github.com/programmable-logic-tools/libalterapof/tree/master/doc">libalterpof</a>.
<br/><br/>
The official device family datasheet can be found <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/programmable/us/en/pdfs/literature/ds/archives/m7000.pdf">here</a>. 

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

Keep in mind that this is a third-party specification.
Therefore it may be incorrect, inaccurate or incomplete.
There may be no technical measure present in your device preventing you from loading a flawed bitstream.
If you use the information on this page to program your device, you may permanently damage or destroy your hardware.
The authors expressly disclaim any liability for damages arising from any kind of usage of this document.
