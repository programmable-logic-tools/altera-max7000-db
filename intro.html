<h1>The Altera {:s} CPLD bitstream format</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

This is an inofficial, third-party documentation for the bitstream format of Altera's {:s} Complex Programmable Logic Device (CPLD).
Intended audience are programmers experienced with Verilog, C and C++.
The official device family datasheet can be found <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/programmable/us/en/pdfs/literature/ds/archives/m7000.pdf">here</a>.

<h3>Reference software</h3>
The official way to generate bitstreams for this device is to use the bitstream writer of Altera Quartus-II.
That bitstream writer imports a mapped and place-and-routed design and generates a POF file as output.
A POF file contains the raw bitstream alongside some metadata.
Furthermore, Quartus-II can produce a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Vector_Format">Serial Vector Format</a> file (SVF) from a raw bitstream.
Such a file contains a sequence of JTAG transactions,
that when played back via a JTAG adapter such as Busblaster
programs the flash memory of the connected CPLD with the corresponding bitstream.

Keep in mind that this is a third-party specification.
Therefore it may be incorrect, inaccurate or incomplete.
There may be no technical measure present in your device preventing you from loading a flawed bitstream.
If you use the information on this page to program your device, you may permanently damage or destroy your hardware.
